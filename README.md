[![Report PDF](https://github.com/ahmedfarhat25/Tawsill-new-enhancments/blob/main/Tawsilla%20Enhancment%20report.pdf)  

## 🔍 Research Methodology
Before developing this enhancement strategy, I conducted comprehensive market research:

1. **Competitive Analysis**:
   - Studied 5 leading ride-hailing platforms (Uber, Careem, Bolt, etc.)
   - Documented 32 key features across web and mobile experiences
   - Analyzed UX patterns and conversion strategies

2. **Gap Identification**:
   - Compared Tawsilla's existing website with:
     - Competitor websites (desktop/mobile)
     - Tawsilla's own mobile app features
   - Identified 18 missing web features from mobile app
   - Found 7 unique competitor features worth adopting

3. **User Journey Mapping**:
   - Created 4 persona profiles (riders/drivers, tech-savvy/novice)
   - Mapped pain points across 12 touchpoints

> This report synthesizes these findings into actionable enhancements for Tawsilla's digital presence.
